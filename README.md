<h1>1.1 Stealth Method <a name="stealth" href="https://postgresql.org"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-orange.svg"/></a></h1>
An obfuscating C-code from 2011 was optimized and assembled to fit DirtyMike and xmrig. It hides all necessary but unwanted processes from all process queries.

<h1>1.2 Bootable Flash Drive <strong>BOII</strong> running Ubuntu with DirtyMike <a name="boii" href="https://postgresql.org"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-orange.svg"/></a></h1>
No HDDs/SSDs, OS needed anymore. This bootable NTFS boot stick designed with heatsink will deliver everything necessary for mining from boot on (run level 1).
What you will need is any mainboard with 3.0 USB bus (recommended), CPU and RAM. Additionally the flash drive can be plugged while Windows (10) is running which will open a tiny interface to insert a wallet address and will start to mine.
